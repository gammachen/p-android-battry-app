    <string name="health_charging_type_slow_analogy">Analogy: Using a small water pipe with constant, gentle water flow to fill the tank.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_slow_tech">Technical explanation: Usually refers to charging with power below 10W-15W. Uses standard 5V voltage and lower current, the voltage and current remain basically unchanged throughout the process, and only slightly adjusts when nearly full.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_slow_advantages">Advantages: Low heat generation, minimal chemical pressure on the battery, beneficial for long-term battery health.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_slow_disadvantages">Disadvantages: Slow charging speed.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_slow_when" formatted="false">When it happens: Using old chargers or incompatible fast charging protocols.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_analogy">Analogy: Using a fire hose to fill quickly initially, then automatically switching back to a small water pipe when the tank is nearly full.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_tech">Technical explanation: Refers to technology that increases charging power to 18W or more by increasing voltage and/or current. It is not full power from beginning to end, but an intelligent, multi-stage process:</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_stage1">Stage 1: Constant current pre-charge: If the battery power is extremely low, it will be activated with a small current first.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_stage2" formatted="false">Stage 2: Constant current fast charge (core stage): The charger and phone negotiate the highest safe power (such as 27W, 65W), charging at maximum power during this stage, with power rapidly increasing from 0% to 50%-70%.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_stage3" formatted="false">Stage 3: Constant voltage and decreasing current: When the battery voltage reaches the upper limit (about 4.2V-4.4V), the charger maintains the voltage unchanged, and the current gradually decreases. Power also decreases accordingly. In this stage, power increases from 70% to above 90%.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_advantages">Advantages: Greatly shortens charging time and solves battery anxiety.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_fast_disadvantages">Disadvantages: Generates more heat compared to slow charging, has a slight impact on long-term battery health (but modern phone management systems have controlled this within safe limits).</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_analogy">Analogy: When the tank is about to be full, use a dropper to add one drop at a time until it is completely and precisely full.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_tech">Technical explanation: This is the final stage of charging (usually after 95% or 98%). At this time, the charging power is extremely low (may only be 1-2W), and the battery is slowly charged to 100% with a very small current.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_purpose">Purpose:</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_purpose_protect">- Protect the battery: Avoid continuous high-current impact when the battery is nearly full, reducing battery pressure and heat generation.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_purpose_calibrate">- Calibrate the fuel gauge: Allow the phone to more accurately determine the "100%" point.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_trickle_smart" formatted="false">Smart application: Optimized Battery Charging uses trickle charging principles.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_conclusion">Core Conclusions and Recommendations:</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_conclusion_1">1. Protocol matching is key: To achieve fast charging, it is necessary to ensure that the phone supports, the charger supports, and the data cable also supports the same fast charging protocol. Otherwise, it will automatically downgrade to slow charging.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_conclusion_2">2. Looking at power (W) is more meaningful than looking at V or A alone: Power directly reflects charging speed. A 30W charger is usually faster than an 18W one.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_conclusion_3">3. Universal choice: Currently, the USB PD (including PPS) protocol is the most universal and promising fast charging standard, supported by Apple, Google, Samsung, and many laptop manufacturers.</string>
    <string name="health_charging_type_conclusion_4">4. No need to fear fast charging damaging the battery: Under strict temperature control and intelligent management by phone manufacturers, the additional loss of fast charging on battery life is very limited.</string>
